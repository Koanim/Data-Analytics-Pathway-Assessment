    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a member of our data analytics team, your role will involve creating tools that use our operational data to help the business achieve its goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, the objective is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (indicated by the variable \"y\" as \"yes\" or \"no\"). Your task is to build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit based on the features provided in the dataset. "

    "### Tasks include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) \n",
    "\n",
    "Identify patterns, correlations, and any necessary data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate which features might be most relevant to predicting client subscription and consider creating new features if applicable. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Build a Predictive Model \n",
    "\n",
    "Use a machine learning algorithm of choice to build a model predicting the subscription outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluate Model Performance \n",
    "\n",
    "Use appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model effectiveness. Consider any imbalanced classes and adjust accordingly, possibly using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or adjusting the class weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain the Findings and Insights  \n",
    "\n",
    "Summarize key findings from the EDA and insights from the model, such as which features were most impactful, common characteristics of clients likely to subscribe, and actionable recommendations for the marketing team. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Relevant Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. \n",
    "   The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, \n",
    "   in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. \n",
    "\n",
    "   There are two datasets: \n",
    "      1) bank-full.csv with all examples, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010).\n",
    "      2) bank.csv with 10% of the examples (4521), randomly selected from bank-full.csv.\n",
    "   The smallest dataset is provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g. SVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Number of Instances: 45211 for bank-full.csv (4521 for bank.csv)\n",
